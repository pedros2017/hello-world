# hello-world
=============

I created this repostiory and an automatic read-me file as the Github starter guide told me.

=============


From this line on I'm editing what was previously written on the README.md file.
I'm just adding changes to be saved on this file. I'm "commiting" to this file.
I hope that I'll learn to code soon enough.

Bye.
